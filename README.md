# co2-emission-UK-US-1800-2019

comparing the co2 emission from human activity (coal, burning of fuel, gas) starting from the 1800's to 2019
in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Link to dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions

Link to Visulisation tool: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charles.muiruri


**Software & Programming Languages used**

Microsoft Excel: Extracting and Sorting out columns/rows of data whilst also checking for any misleading or missing values. 
As there were some missing values, I decided to leave them NULL.

MYSQL: Importing the dataset into SQl, cleaning and transforming the data into useful information.

Tableau: Presented beautiful visulisations and statistics of how much co2 emission is extracted from the UK compared to the US. comparative bar charts and graphs are showcased. 


My main motivation for this project was to see how exactly as human beings, a smaller country like the United kingdom compares to the 4th largest country in the world being the United States. 

Form the data I had calculated I had found the exact percentages of what human activity per capita **(e.g road, Oil & natural gasses, agricultural Soils)** are shown to emphasize where exactly the high amounts of co2 emission is being taken out, having the purpose of finding ways to prevent larger kt (kilotons) of carbon footprint as global warming presents many environmental dangers to humans and animals. 

The amount of carbon emissions trapped in our atmosphere causes global warming leading to climate change causing ie. Increased heat, drought and insect outbreaks.
